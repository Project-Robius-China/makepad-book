# Makepad Project Packaging Guide

Requirements for packaging a Makepad project depend on the target platform. This guide provides an overview of how to package your Makepad application for different platforms, including desktop and mobile.

## Desktop Packaging

Use the `cargo-packager` tool to package your Makepad application.

Before you start packaging your Makepad application, make sure you already install the cargo-packager tool:

```bash
cargo install cargo-packager --locked
```

This tool helps you create packages for your Makepad application, including generating the necessary files and directories for different platforms.

Then configure your `Cargo.toml` file to include the necessary metadata for packaging, also you can create a `packager.toml` file to specify additional packaging options.

This Guide use `Cargo.toml` as an example, but you can also use `packager.toml` to specify packaging options.

```toml
[package.metadata.packager]
product_name = "YourAppName"
identifier = "com.yourcompany.yourapp"
authors = ["Your Name or Team name"]
description = "A brief description of your Makepad application"
### Note: there is an 80-character max for each line of the `long_description`.
long_description = "..."
icons = ["./assets/icon.png"]
out_dir = "./dist"
# ... other packaging options, see the documentation for cargo-packager for more details.

before-packaging-command = """
robius-packaging-commands before-packaging \
    --force-makepad \
    --binary-name <main-binary-name> \
    --path-to-binary ./target/release/<main-binary-name>
"""

# we need to specify the resources that will be included in the package, the packager will copy them to the output directory.
# Note: if you are using Makepad v1.0 or above, you need to specify more resource files:
resources = [
  { src = "./dist/resources/makepad_widgets", target = "makepad_widgets" },
  { src = "./dist/resources/makepad_fonts_chinese_bold", target = "makepad_fonts_chinese_bold" },
  { src = "./dist/resources/makepad_fonts_chinese_bold_2", target = "makepad_fonts_chinese_bold_2" },
  { src = "./dist/resources/makepad_fonts_chinese_regular", target = "makepad_fonts_chinese_regular" },
  { src = "./dist/resources/makepad_fonts_chinese_regular_2", target = "makepad_fonts_chinese_regular_2" },
  { src = "./dist/resources/makepad_fonts_emoji", target = "makepad_fonts_emoji" },
  { src = "./dist/resources/robrix", target = "robrix" },
]

before-each-package-command = """
robius-packaging-commands before-each-package \
    --force-makepad \
    --binary-name <main-binary-name> \
    --path-to-binary ./target/release/<main-binary-name> \
"""

```

And we use the small `robius-packaging-commands` CLI tool to run the packaging commands before packaging your Makepad application.

You can install the `robius-packaging-commands` tool using the following command:

```bash
cargo install --locked --git https://github.com/project-robius/robius-packaging-commands.git
```
If you don't want to use the `robius-packaging-commands` tool, you can also run the packaging commands manually, but it is recommended to use the tool for convenience.
and manually copy the resources to the output directory.

Such as:

```toml
[package.metadata.packager]

before-packaging-command = """
cargo run --manifest-path packaging/before-packaging-command/Cargo.toml before-packaging
"""

before-each-package-command = """
cargo run --manifest-path packaging/before-packaging-command/Cargo.toml before-each-package
"""

```

### before-packaging-command

The below command primarily uses cargo-metadata to determine the path of the `makepad_widgets` crate on the host build system,and copies the `makepad-widgets/resources` directory to the `./dist/resources/makepad_widgets` directory.

We also copy the your app project's `resources/` directory to the `./dist/resources/<main-binary-name>` directory.

This is necessary because the `cargo packager` command only supports defining resources at a known path
(see the `resources = [...]` block below),so we need to copy the resources to a known fixed (static) path before packaging, such that cargo-packager can locate them and include them in the final package.

### before-each-package-command

We then build the entire your app project and set the `MAKEPAD`/`MAKEPAD_PACKAGE_DIR` env vars to the proper value.

For macOS app bundles, this should be set to `.` because we set the `apple_bundle` cfg option for Makepad, which causes Makepad to look for resources in the `Contents/Resources/` directory,
which is where the resources are located for an Apple app bundle (`.app` and `.dmg`).

For Debian `.deb` packages, this should be set to `/usr/lib/<main-binary-name>`, which is currently `/usr/lib/<main-binary-name>`.
This is the directory in which `dpkg` copies app resource files to when installing the `.deb` package.

On Linux, we also strip the binaries of unneeded content, as required for Debian packages.

For Debian and Pacman (still a to-do!) packages, we also auto-generate the list of dependencies required by your application.

### Linux (Debian/Ubuntu)

1. install necessary dependencies for packaging:

```bash
sudo apt-get update
sudo apt-get install libssl-dev libsqlite3-dev pkg-config binfmt-support libxcursor-dev libx11-dev libasound2-dev libpulse-dev
```

2. run the packaging command:

```bash
cargo packager --release
```

### Windows(Windows-2022)

if you already configure your `Cargo.toml` file as described above, you can run the packaging command:

```bash
cargo packager --release --formats nsis
```

### MacOS

if you already configure your `Cargo.toml` file as described above, you can run the packaging command:

```bash
cargo packager --release
```

## Mobile Packaging

Luckly, Makepad provides a convenient way to package your app for mobile platforms using `cargo-makepad`.

```bash
cargo install --force --git https://github.com/makepad/makepad.git --branch dev cargo-makepad
```

### Android

Android can easyly be packaged using `cargo-makepad`:

```bash
cargo makepad android install-toolchain
carog makepad android build -p your_profile_name -release # it will build the apk, then you can install it on your device or emulator.
```


### iOS

```bash
cargo makepad apple ios install-toolchain
```

use `cargo-makepad` to build the iOS app:
```bash
cargo makepad apple ios --org=organisation_name --app=product_name run-sim/run-device -p your_profile_name --release

in order for makepad to be able to install an ios application on a real device a provisioning profile is needed. 
To create one make an empty application in xcode and give it an organisation
name and product name you copy exactly and without spaces/odd characters into --org=x and --app=x
                         --stable use stable compiler
 Also run it on the device it at least once, so the profile is created
                         --org=organisation_name
                         --app=product_name
 If you have multiple signing identities or devices or provision profiles you might have to set it explicitly
                         --profile=
                         --cert=
                         --device=
```

Because `cargo-makepad` does not have a separate `build` command, you can directly use the `run-sim` or `run-device` command to build the application, and then package it.

```bash
# Build and run the application on the iOS simulator using this command
cargo makepad apple ios --org=org.robius --app=robrix run-sim -p robrix --release

# cargo-makepad tool will compile and package the iOS application, generating the corresponding application package in the ./target/makepad-apple-app/aarch64-apple-ios-sim/release/robrix.app directory.
# By using the zip command to compress the .app directory into a .zip file, you can distribute it to others or upload it to TestFlight or the App Store.

# By this command to build and run the application on an iOS device, where --device (device_identifier) can set the virtual one.
# Note: You need to replace $YOUR_PROFILE_PATH, $YOUR_CERT_FINGERPRINT, and IPhone with your actual provisioning profile path, certificate fingerprint, and device name.
cargo makepad apple ios \
  --org=org.robius \
  --app=robrix \
  --profile=$YOUR_PROFILE_PATH \
  --cert=$YOUR_CERT_FINGERPRINT \
  --device=IPhone \
  run-device -p robrix --release

# Seem as above, you can use the zip command to compress the .app directory into a .zip file for distribution or uploading to TestFlight or the App Store.
cd ./target/makepad-apple-app/aarch64-apple-ios/release
mkdir Payload
cp -r robrix.app Payload/
zip -r robrix-ios.ipa Payload

```


## Wasm Packaging

Makepad also supports compiling applications to WebAssembly (Wasm), allowing your app to run in the browser.

To package your application for Wasm, you can use the following commands:

```bash
cargo makepad wasm install-toolchain # install Wasm toolchain
cargo makepad wasm run -p your_profile_name --release
```

This will build your Makepad application as a Wasm module and run it in the browser, while also generating the corresponding HTML and JavaScript files in the /target/makepad-wasm-app/release/your_profile_name/ directory.

It includes: makepad static resources and your application's resource files, as well as the related js_bridge files and the wasm module.
